## React Best Practices Implementation

This project follows React best practices as outlined in the official React documentation. Here are the key practices implemented:

### 1. Component Design Principles

#### Single Responsibility Principle

- Each component has a single, well-defined purpose
- Components are focused on one aspect of the UI
- Complex components are broken down into smaller, manageable pieces

#### Composition over Inheritance

- Components are composed together rather than using inheritance
- Higher-order components (HOCs) and render props are used when needed
- Custom hooks provide reusable logic across components

#### Declarative Programming

- Components describe what the UI should look like, not how to achieve it
- State changes are handled through React's built-in mechanisms
- Side effects are managed through useEffect and custom hooks

### 2. State Management

#### Controlled Components

```typescript
// Good: Controlled input
const [value, setValue] = useState('');
<input value={value} onChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value)} />
```

#### State Lifting

- State is lifted to the common parent when multiple components need access
- Data flows down through props
- Events flow up through callback functions

#### Custom Hooks

- Reusable stateful logic is extracted into custom hooks
- Hooks follow the naming convention `use` prefix
- Complex state logic is separated from component rendering

### 3. Performance Optimization

#### React.memo

- Components are wrapped with React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Memoization is applied to components that receive stable props

#### useCallback and useMemo

- Event handlers are memoized with useCallback
- Expensive calculations are memoized with useMemo
- Dependencies are carefully managed to ensure proper memoization

#### Code Splitting

- Large components are split using React.lazy and Suspense
- Routes are code-split for better initial load performance

### 4. Error Handling

#### Error Boundaries

- Error boundaries catch JavaScript errors in component trees
- Fallback UI is provided for error states
- Errors are logged and reported appropriately

#### Proper Error States

- Loading states are handled gracefully
- Network errors are caught and displayed
- User-friendly error messages are provided

### 5. Accessibility

#### Semantic HTML

- Proper HTML elements are used for their intended purpose
- ARIA attributes are applied when necessary
- Keyboard navigation is supported

#### Focus Management

- Focus is managed appropriately in dynamic content
- Tab order is logical and intuitive
- Focus indicators are visible and clear

### 6. Testing

#### Component Testing

- Components are tested in isolation
- User interactions are simulated
- Edge cases and error states are covered

#### Integration Testing

- Component interactions are tested
- API integration is tested
- User workflows are validated

## Usage Guidelines

1. **API Agents**: These run on the server side and handle backend operations
2. **Component Agents**: These run in the browser and handle user interface
3. **Data Agents**: These provide shared utilities for data operations

## Security Considerations

- All agents that handle sensitive data should implement proper validation
- API agents should include authentication checks
- Crypto operations should use secure, well-tested libraries
- User input should be sanitized and validated at all agent boundaries

## Development Notes

- Agents are designed to be modular and reusable
- Each agent has a single responsibility
- Agents communicate through well-defined interfaces
- Error handling is implemented at the agent level

## React Development Guidelines

### Component Structure

```typescript
// Recommended component structure
interface ComponentProps {
  // Props interface
}

const Component: React.FC<ComponentProps> = ({ prop1, prop2 }) => {
  // 1. State declarations
  const [state, setState] = useState();

  // 2. Custom hooks
  const customHook = useCustomHook();

  // 3. Event handlers
  const handleEvent = useCallback(() => {
    // Event logic
  }, [dependencies]);

  // 4. Effects
  useEffect(() => {
    // Side effects
  }, [dependencies]);

  // 5. Render logic
  return (
    <div>
      {/* JSX */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default React.memo(Component);
```

### File Organization

- Components are organized in feature-based folders
- Each component has its own file with matching name
- Related components are grouped together
- Shared components are placed in a common directory

### Naming Conventions

- Components use PascalCase (e.g., `QuizQuestion`)
- Files match component names (e.g., `QuizQuestion.tsx`)
- Props interfaces are named with `Props` suffix
- Custom hooks start with `use` prefix
- Event handlers start with `handle` prefix

### TypeScript Integration

- All components are typed with TypeScript
- Props interfaces are defined for all components
- Generic types are used for reusable components
- Strict mode is enabled for better type safety

## Future Enhancements

- Consider implementing agent health checks
- Add monitoring and logging for agent operations
- Implement agent communication patterns for complex workflows
- Add agent configuration management
